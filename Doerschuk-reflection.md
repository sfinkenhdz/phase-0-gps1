#### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled most with switching between branches on the local repo via CLI. I had a hard difficult time understanding why I would switch between a branch and why sometimes files were getting moved around. Experience and practice is fixing this issue for me.

#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Making sure to git pull before you do anything on the CLI on your local repo. This command is making sure you charge your phone before you go to work. If you forget, “You’re gonna have a bad time” as they say in South Park.

#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What was the best practice in making comments when you make a commit. Should you open up a new .md file or just add the "-m" modifier and add as required.

#### What still confuses you about git?
Merge conflicts. I somewhat followed with the lesson, but I would like to see it in action. I don't see how there would be merge conflicts when and if everybody pulls from the master from the remote and repo and make changes on local branches.

#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was definitely not a cake walk. I didn't expect it to be easy, but seeing the 7 releases I would need to complete in under an hour seemed daunting at the beginning. I am not worried about it though, just keep my head down and plugging away and it will come.
