What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
It's not so much specific things that I don't understand, but rather it's just taking time and repetition for the whole git/GitHub system to feel comfortable and natural to me, rather than having to think through each thing that I'm doing. Some of it is coming together, but sometimes I have to really slow down and think, where am I, what am I trying to do, what are the steps, etc.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Honestly, I don't feel like this was super helpful for clarification purposes, but only because this was my first pairing session of any kind, and it was a challenge getting used to the set up.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I think mainly I asked things like, is this right? The big stumbling block that the guide helped with was when my partner couldn't access the repo I pushed to GitHub. It turned out that I had saved it do the wrong place, so he didn't have access to it. Makes total sense now, but absolutely didn't at the time. I think my partner was better at asking clarifying questions, and I'd like to be more intentional about this in my next GPS.

What still confuses you about git?
I think I understand git pretty well. It's more keeping track of the masters and branches and repos of git and GitHub and navigating around the various applications that I'm a little shaky on. The more I use git/GitHub, the easier it gets though.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was harder than I thought it would be. I think it will get easier, but at this point I'm still getting used to the commands and going from terminal to sublime to GitHub, etc. and having two other people and another person's screen just made it harder. I can see the utility of this set up and think it will get easier and more useful going forward as I get used to it.
